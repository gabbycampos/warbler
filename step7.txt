Step Seven: Research and Understand Login Strategy

Look over the code in app.py related to authentication.

    How is the logged in user being kept track of?
    What is Flaskâ€™s g object?
    What is the purpose of add_user_to_g?
    What does @app.before_request mean?

1. The logged in user is being kept track of by 'session[CURR_USER_KEY] = user.id'

2. Flask's g object is a global object. Makes it accessible to other objects.

3. The purpose of 'add_user_to_g' is to add the user from the session to a global object.

4. '@app.before_request' is a decorator that will run the 'add_user_to_g' function before every request.
before_request functions are ideal for tasks such as:
    * Opening database connections
    * Loading a user from the session
    * Working with the flask g object
